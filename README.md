     - port is optional and defaults to 445 if not provided
     - sharename is required
   ```

 - The url format for WebDAV is
   ```
   webdav://hostname[:port]/[url_path]
   webdavs://hostname[:port]/[url_path]

     - hostname can be the textual hostname or an IP address. hostname is required
     - port is optional and defaults to 80(webdav) and 443(webdavs) if not provided
     - url_path is optional based on your WebDAV hosting requiremets
   ```
  
 - The url format for HTTP is
   ```

 - [Dufs](https://github.com/sigoden/dufs) - For hosting your own WebDAV server.
 - [SFTPgo](https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo) - For local hosted WebDAV server. Can also be used as a webdav frontend for Cloud Storage like AWS S3, Azure Blob or Google Storage.
